# Shell Script Programming

## Call Commands
Simply speaking, *shell programming* is a bunch of shell commands with a control a little. You already have used a various command, like *cd*, *grep* and so on. 

If you want to print the string, "This is shell programming", in your shell, you could enter the command like below.
```shell
$ echo "This is shell programming"
```
Okay, that's very simple. Then now,  let's repeat the string 100 times. How do you do that? 

Here's other example. Now, you have to do more complex job. 
You have a linux service application and you should install and configure it to the server. There's a lot of works to do. 
For instance, copying a execution file and resource files from a local computer to a runnig server, setting or getting some environment variables, print error messages if there is an error... What's your plan to do those jobs?

## Create a script file
The shell script file is runable by shell itself. 
Normally, a file extension of shell script is '.sh'. However, it is not mandantory.
